# Automated SDLC Compliance Checker for IEC 62443 Standards

### Project Overview
This project includes scripts and tools for automating security compliance checks against IEC 62443 standards.
The repository contains sample code files that intentionally include security vulnerabilities. The project uses Bandit for static analysis to detect these vulnerabilities and generates compliance reports which can be analyzed and visualized.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Power BI Desktop for visualization

### Requirements
The following libraries are required to run this project:

#### External Libraries
These libraries need to be installed via `pip`:
- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to interact with the GitHub API.
- `pandas`: Used for reading and manipulating the CSV report generated by Bandit.
- `bandit`: Used for performing static security analysis on the Python code.
- `matplotlib`: Used for creating visualizations of the data from the CSV report.
- `flask`: Used for potential web-based interaction or further extensions.

#### Standard Libraries
These libraries are included with Python and do not need to be installed separately:
- `os`: Used for interacting with the operating system (e.g., reading environment variables, creating directories).
- `logging`: Used for logging messages to help with debugging and tracking the flow of the program.
- `subprocess`: Used for running Bandit as a subprocess.
- `csv`: Used for reading the CSV compliance report.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Abdelkhalekmohamed/Automated-SDLC-Compliance-Checker-for-IEC-62443-Standards.git
    cd Automated-SDLC-Compliance-Checker-for-IEC-62443-Standards
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the compliance check**:
    ```sh
    python compliance_check.py
    ```

4. **Analyze the compliance report**:
    ```sh
    python analyze_report.py
    ```

### Usage

1. Ensure that your GitHub token (if needed) is set in your environment variables for secure access to private repositories.
2. Execute the compliance check script to analyze the repository's code.
3. Use the analyze report script to generate visualizations of the compliance report.
