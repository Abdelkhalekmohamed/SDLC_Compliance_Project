# SDLC Compliance Automation for IEC 62443 Standards

## Project Overview
This project focuses on automating the process of checking SDLC compliance against IEC 62443 standards using Python for data collection and analysis, and Power BI for visualization and reporting.

## Objective
To develop a mini project that automates the detection of secure coding practices and generates compliance reports through a Python script and a Power BI dashboard.

## Scope
This project will automate the detection of common security vulnerabilities in code repositories and generate compliance reports, which can then be visualized and explored using Power BI.

## Project Structure
ionally include security vulnerabilities. The project uses Bandit for static analysis to detect these vulnerabilities and generates compliance reports which can be analyzed and visualized.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)
- Power BI Desktop for visualization

### Requirements
The following libraries are required to run this project:

#### External Libraries
These libraries need to be installed via `pip`:
- `requests`: Used for making HTTP requests to interact with the GitHub API.
- `pandas`: Used for reading and manipulating the CSV report generated by Bandit.
- `bandit`: Used for performing static security analysis on the Python code.
- `matplotlib`: Used for creating visualizations of the data from the CSV report.
- `flask`: Used for potential web-based interaction or further extensions.

#### Standard Libraries
These libraries are included with Python and do not need to be installed separately:
- `os`: Used for interacting with the operating system (e.g., reading environment variables, creating directories).
- `logging`: Used for logging messages to help with debugging and tracking the flow of the program.
- `subprocess`: Used for running Bandit as a subprocess.
- `csv`: Used for reading the CSV compliance report.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install Required Tools
1. **Install Python**:
    - Download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)
2. **Install Power BI Desktop**:
    - Download and install Power BI Desktop from the official website: [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/)

### Step 2: Create a Sample Code Repository
1. **Set up a GitHub repository**:
    - Create a GitHub repository and add a few sample code files that intentionally contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., hardcoded passwords, SQL injections).

### Step 3: Generate Compliance Report
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Abdelkhalekmohamed/Automated-SDLC-Compliance-Checker-for-IEC-62443-Standards.git
    cd Automated-SDLC-Compliance-Checker-for-IEC-62443-Standards
    ```

2. **Install the required Python packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the compliance check**:
    ```sh
    python compliance_check.py
    ```

### Step 4: Power BI Dashboard Development
1. **Import Data into Power BI**:
    - Open Power BI Desktop.
    - Import `compliance_report.csv` as a new data source.

2. **Create Visualizations**:
    - **Overview Chart**: Bar chart showing the count of issues by severity (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
    - **Detail Table**: Table displaying filename, line number, issue text, confidence, and severity.

3. **Interactive Elements**:
    - Add slicers to filter data by severity and confidence levels.
    - Create a drill-down functionality to view issues in detail.

### Step 5: Testing and Validation
1. **Run the Python Script**:
    - Execute the Python script to generate the `compliance_report.csv`.

2. **Update Power BI Dashboard**:
    - Refresh the data in Power BI to reflect the latest compliance report.
    - Verify that the visualizations accurately represent the data.

### Step 6: Documentation
1. **Project Report**:
    - Document the process, including setup, script functionalities, and Power BI dashboard design.
    - Provide a user guide for running the Python script and interacting with the Power BI dashboard.

## Deliverables
1. **Python Script**:
    - A well-documented Python script (`compliance_check.py`).

2. **Power BI Dashboard**:
    - A Power BI file (`SDLC_Compliance_Dashboard.pbix`) with interactive visualizations.

3. **Documentation**:
    - A detailed report (`Project_Report.pdf`) describing the project workflow, script usage, and dashboard features.

## Usage
1. Ensure that your GitHub token (if needed) is set in your environment variables for secure access to private repositories.
2. Execute the compliance check script to analyze the repository's code.
3. Use the analyze report script to generate visualizations of the compliance report.
